In this test data, we use rice chr1 to chr12 to extract chr1-specific sequences.
We performed the OrthoFinder using the protein files divided by rice chr1 to chr12 for test data.
You can confirm the result in Orthogroups.GeneCount.tsv that pre-filtered to save data volume (i.e. Orthogroups are filtered in chr1-specific and more than 5 copies).

Put all test data in your working directory, and decompress genomic fasta.gz.
Some change of script may need depending on your environment.
First, change the following data paths if you call other than the current directory: Orthogroups.GeneCount.tsv, Orthogroups.txt, cds_from_genomic_w0.fna, genomic_CDS_exon.gff, and chr1 to chr12 genomic fna.
Second, change num (number of threads) depending on your environment.
